ENT308-S - Build your next microservices application with modern AWS services

when you are building a service, start with a "why?"
  - do you need super scalability?

Definition of a modern microservice:
1. devops: leverages a code pipeline
1. autoscaled: doesn't require manual scaling (example: EC2 autoscaling groups)
1. cloud-native: based on cloud-compute (example: Lambda and CloudFront)
1. orchestrated: low cost of operational burden (example: EKS)
  
their example service uses EKS + Lambda + Fargate
Benefits:
 - Operations: Don't have to worry about underlying servers
 - Cost: No traffic, No cost
 - Productivity: higher abstraction


monitoring: goal is "single pane of glass" that has everything you need
